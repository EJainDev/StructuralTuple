## Code of Conduct

See [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting Bugs

Before submitting a bug report, ensure the issue hasn't been reported already. Provide clear, concise details to help maintainers reproduce and fix the issue.

### Compile Errors

To report compile errors, specify:
1. The exact error message or symptom.
2. The compiler and version (for example, GCC 16.1) and the CMake version used (for example, 4.3.0).
3. The full compiler output / compilation log.
4. A minimal, self-contained reproducible example (smallest code that reproduces the problem).
5. The exact build commands or CMake preset used to reproduce the issue (for example: `cmake --preset debug-gcc-16` and `cmake --build --preset build-debug`).

### Runtime Bugs

To report runtime bugs, specify:
1. What happened.
2. What should have happened.
3. A minimal reproducing example.
4. Why it could have happened (optional).
5. Steps to reproduce the behavior (exact commands, inputs, and any environment information required to trigger the issue).

## Feature Requests

Feature requests drive the growth of this library. All requests are welcome, even if you cannot implement them yourself. The feature request template includes a "Testing Commitment" checkbox — please select one of the following options to indicate your level of involvement:

- **Test only**: I can help test or validate a PR but will not implement it.
- **Implement and test (PR)**: I will implement the feature and submit a PR that includes tests.
- **Neither**: I cannot implement or test this change; this is a request only.

When possible, prefer **Implement and test (PR)** so the change can be reviewed and merged more quickly. Include:
1. Feature description.
2. Intent and use case for the feature.
3. Example usage (optional).

## Local Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install GCC 16.1 and CMake 4.3 or higher.
3. Configure the project using the `debug-gcc-16` preset: `cmake --preset debug-gcc-16`
4. Build the project using the `build-debug` preset: `cmake --build --preset build-debug`

## Testing Guidelines

- Use Google Test as the testing framework.
- Run the full test suite before submitting changes: `ctest --preset build-debug`
- All tests must pass. Do not break existing functionality.
- Add new tests for new features.
- Add regression tests for bug fixes.
- Verify that changes compile and run correctly across supported platforms.

## Style & Commit Rules

- Format code using `clang-format`. Run `clang-format -i <file>` before committing.
- Follow general guidelines using `clang-tidy`. If you disable a check (globally or locally), explain the rationale in your PR.
- Use conventional commit messages: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
  - `feat`: New feature
  - `fix`: Bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
  - `refactor`: Code refactoring
  - `test`: Adding or modifying tests
  - `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Create a separate branch for each feature or fix.
- Keep PRs focused. One PR per feature/fix.
- Update documentation if API or behavior changes.
- Link related issues in the PR description.
- Ensure all tests pass locally before requesting a review.

## Review Process

1. **Local Verification:** Ensure all tests pass and code is formatted correctly.
2. **Maintainer Review:** Maintainers will evaluate functionality, code quality, and alignment with project goals.
3. **Feedback Loop:** Address review comments promptly. Push updates to the same branch.
4. **Merge:** Once approved, a maintainer will squash and merge the PR.
5. **Release:** Changes will be included in the next scheduled release or hotfix.
